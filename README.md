=============

Common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses
# Project Description
This project asked you to develop an application that provides a list of items  
within a variety of categories as well as provide a user registration and   
authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post,  
edit and delete their own items.

# How to complete this project  
1.Install Vagrant and VirtualBox  
2.Clone the fullstack-nanodegree-vm  
3.Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)  
4.Write your Flask application locally in the vagrant/catalog directory  
(which will automatically be synced to /vagrant/catalog within the VM).  
5.Run your application within the VM (python /vagrant/catalog/application.py)   
6.Access and test your application by visiting http://localhost:8000 locally    

# What will learn?
You will learn how to develop a RESTful web application using the Python 
framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication.   
You will then learn when to properly use the various HTTP methods available   
to you and how these methods   relate to CRUD  
(create, read, update and delete)operations.
